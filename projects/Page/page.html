            <p>Laie is the best place to see the sunset and we can visit to the temple. It is very
                good place to visit and feel God's love in his house. </p>
            <p>In Laie, We can also see the BYUH. There are many students from diverse countries.
                We can learn and share many cultures each others.
            </p>
            <p>Also, Polynesian culture center is good place to learn about their cultures and enjoy with family.</p>
